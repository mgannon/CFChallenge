2) Our images have a ratio of 16:9, and our design layouts have 12 pixel wide increments 
(there are no limits on height). Give examples of three image sizes that would have the 
correct ratio and would fit the design layout.

The answer to this is simple, and requires very little calculations on the part of the programmer.
To get the answer, use he tools one has already, namely an image editor like photoshop or GIMP.

-start with a 1600x900 pixel image (since this was the first image size of that ratio that came to mind)
-lock the ratio of pixels, and then rescale it a few times to get several answers

And poof! you're done!

Some sample image sizes, limited by units of 12 are:

1200x675

240x135

720x405



One of the greatest attributes of programmers: they are lazy.  (which means you use whatever tools that are already created to help solve problems.)
